# Introduction

## How to contribute?

The whole process is based on Pull Request, so:

1. Fork the repository and create a branch in it

> The branch name will not play any role.

> If you think your changes should be checked in immediately, create a branch from "master". Otherwise use "beta"

2. Make the necessary changes

3. Submit a request to the upstream branch of the original repository.

## Pull Request Verification Process

The project uses GitHub Actions that validate the code. After successful verification from the CI/CD and team side, your code will be included in the project.

```
import { Grid } from 'wuki';
```

## Entities

Grid contains two entities:
  1. Container - defines a columnar system built on CSS Grid, which is many times more convenient and easier to use than CSS FlexBox.
```
<Grid container>
</Grid>
```
  2. Element - is a column in a column system.
```
<Grid col={12}>
</Grid>
```
In standard situations, you should stick to as few `<Grid container>` as possible. One container is enough to create standard page layout and cover all needs.

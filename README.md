#### 🧸 Wuki is a UI Kit developed for React.js that brings together the best practices of the most popular UI libraries such as Ant Design, Bootstrap, Element and many others.

### 🚀 Installation
```bash
yarn add wuki
# or
npm install wuki
```
### 👋🏼 Basic principles
- Intuitive use, borrowed from already proven libraries and proven in practical use
- Flexible configuration of source data, for maximum adaptability for various projects
- No clutter in styles and transmitted data, both during development and in the assembled application
- Easy to develop and maintain. Automation of checks, tests, and other crap that can only be automated
- A modern approach to development at every stage. No old shit needed for browsers like IE


### 🎯 Target
Create a UI system for comfortable use in modern projects that does not store old and useless code inside itself, using modern css properties.

> Important: Browsers like IE are likely to have poor support, but don't care.

**Status:** In developing 👨🏻‍💻
